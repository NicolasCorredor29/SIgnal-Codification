# SIgnal-Codification<br>
This code simulates the encoding of digital signals through 3 types of encoding:<br>
hbd3: bipolar coding based on parity and polarity states<br>
2B1Q: Multilevel coding based on the polarity of the previous level<br>
MLT3 Encoding: Multi-stream Encoding<br>
<br>
Input: Bit sequences<br>
Input example: 11001010010<br>
<br>
Output: Arrangement with power levels in Volts<br>
Output example: +1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0
